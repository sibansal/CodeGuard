Code Guard is an open-source app that helps developers prevent accidental leakage of proprietary organization code. It allows you to add a set of tokens, such as organization names, program names, etc., and listens for any occurrences of those tokens in the clipboard. If a token is detected in the clipboard, Code Guard automatically replaces it with the text: "Prevented by Code Guard".

## Features
